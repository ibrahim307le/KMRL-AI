1. Macroeconomic Context.  The population in India  has grown more than 
threefold since 1950 , resulting in  a young population  of over 1.4 billion ,1 offering  a 
sizeable  labor force and a booming  consumer market. The country is  one of the world’s 
largest economies, powered by a mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors . 
Despite the setback caused by COVID -19, which resulted in an economic contraction of 
nearly 5.8 percent in 2020, the economy rebounded strongly to 7.2 percent in 2022 .2 
The anticipated rate of increase for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to 
be 5.9 percent in 2023 and  6.3 percent  in 2024 .3 In addition, n oticeable  progress has 
been observed in reducing extreme poverty, with estimates suggesting that between

high middle -income status by 2047.5 Nevertheless, the issue of inequality continues to 
endure, as seen by a Gini index of approximately 35 for the preceding two decades .6 
Despite encouraging employment trends since 2020, the employment to population (15+) 
ratio in 2022 is still less than 50 percent  and concerns  linger  about job quality, wage  
growth, and women ’s underrepresentation in the workforc e.7 Recognizing the se

2. Urbanization  of India . India ’s urbanization is gaining pace  as a result of the 
country's improving economic situation . From 1990 to 2022, the urban population has 
steadily increased , growing from 2 6 to 36 percent, bringing the total  number of  urban 
dweller s to a whopping half a billion .9 It is projected that by 2035, India's urban 
population will reach 675 million, representing  43 percent of the entire population .10 This 
swift urbanization is amplifying  the importance of cities as living spaces and economic 
hubs.  Cities in India make up just 3  percent  of the country's territory, yet they account 
for a staggering 60  percent  of its GDP.11 In recent years, urbanization has improved

modernization over the last years . India's road network  (more than 6  million km)13 forms 
the backbone of the country's transport system  through connecting cities, towns, and 
villages with its vast network The Indian Railways  (renowned for its extensive rail 
network spanning 68,103 km14) serves as a vital transport mean  facilitating the 
movement of millions of individuals and substantial amounts of cargo . The extensive

functioning metro rail services covering a length of 895 km and allowing approximately 
10 million passengers to avail this metro service per day .18 This dearth of  public 
transport has led to  traffic congestion and high private vehicle ownership, resulting in  
increased road fatalities19 and CO 2 emissions ( in 2020, the transport sector was

preparation include:   
• Land Acquisition and Utility Shifting: One of the pressing reasons for the 
implementation delay of Phase I stemmed from the delay in completing land 
acquisition  and utility shifting. Learning from Phase I, KMRL has already initiated 
and made substantial progress in both areas  for Phase II.

F. Climate Change  
52. The project inherently supports climate change mitigation by encouraging the 
shift from road -based private transport to more sustainable alternatives with reduced 
GHG emissions. In terms of climate change adaptation, EIA, the preliminary climate and 
geological risk screening (by using Aware) and EDDR identified several climate -related 
hazards, including floods, increased precipitation, high temperature, increased wind 
speed, and water unavailability. A set of adaptatio n measures to be included into the 
DEDs  to address these risks were proposed in the EDDR, as listed in Annex 5 . The 
project can be considered 100 percent climate  mitigation  finance as its main activity

• Value of Time (VOT) Savings . This benefit will stem mainly from (i) time savings 
for modal shift passengers compared to the 'without project' scenario, and (ii) 
time savings for passengers riding on other modes due to less congestion. The 
unit VOT for working and non -working  passenger s was estimated using the

metro was considered 34 km/hour,121 and for the ‘with project’ scenario, the

• VOC  Savings . This benefit will accrue primarily because of a reduced number of 
private vehicles utilized due to  the modal shift  towards public transport,  and 
smoother operation  of other modes  resulting from  less congestion. As a 
conservative approach, only the  VOC savings due to the  absence of  vehicles  
were considered . The mode -wise VOC data (2016 -17) was obtained from the

made were (i) an update of the ridership data as mentioned above, (ii) an increase of 
fare unit rate by 5.6 percent131 instead of 7.5 percent,132 and (iii) an increase of all the 
costs annually until the end of the evaluation period.  
 
6. Financial Costs.  In line with the economic analysis, the following costs were 
identified : (i) capital cost (including the construction cost of the viaduct, stations, cost of 
rolling stock, electrical and mechanical systems), (ii) O&M expenses (i.e., staff, energy, 
and regular maintenance), and (iii) replacement cost for the rolling stock, and som e

in manpower cost due to pay revision and increase in dearness allowance  following KMRL’s current practice . 
The escalation  factors  for O&M expense and energy rate are from Phase I ’s experience.  
135 This is because  the annual increment of labor in India is 3  percent.

1. India is a lower -middle -income country, with a GDP per capita of USD2379.2 
and a population of ~1.4 billion in 2022.138 India’s economy grew at an average annual 
rate of 7.4 percent between FY2014 and FY2018 but slowed down in the years before

tax, rural distress, and stress in the finan cial sector.139140 India’s GDP contracted by 5.8 
percent in FY2020 (year ending in March 2021) on account of stringent lockdown 
restrictions imposed during the first half of the year. With increased mobility and

2. Inflation averaged 6.2 percent in FY2020, primarily driven by food inflation due 
to supply side disruptions. As a response to the pandemic, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) introduced measures to improve credit flow to the productive sectors. Policy rates 
remained unchanged with the RBI maintaining an accommodative stance between 
August 2020 and April 2022. Retail inflation averaged 6.7 percent in FY2022, well above 
the 4± 2 percent inflation targeting band. Elevated food and fuel prices have contributed

inflation moderated and remained within the target band of 4± 2 percent  but spiked in 
July and August 2023 due to high food inflation but moderated to 5 percent in September 
2023. The RBI maintained a pause in its October 2023 policy meeting.

deficit in FY2022 was similar to FY2021 with both revenue and expenditure growing at

increase in the deficit of the states. From April to September 2023, the fiscal deficit 
reached 39.3 percent of the annual target, higher than the previous year. A moderation 
in the deficit and pickup in economic activity helped public debt to decline to 8 1 percent 
of GDP in FY2022.

the second half of FY2023. Private consumption will be affected as higher inflation 
erodes away purchasing power. The GOI’s subsidized food, fertilizer , and gas 
distribution will help offset some of the effects of high in  flation. High policy rates 
may constrain investment spending. Agriculture growth may be subdued due to uneven 
monsoon and lower so wn area while higher borrowing cost and commodity prices may 
impact the manufacturing sector.  
 
8. Overall inflation is expected to moderate to ~5.5 percent in FY2023 due to the 
easing of commodity prices and softening of growth. In May 2022, the RBI indicated"

fear of imported inflation through strengthening of the dollar may push the RBI to furthe r 
raise interest rates in FY2023.  
 
9. The GOI’s fiscal deficit in FY2023 is expected to moderate slightly to 8.8 percent 
of GDP as tax revenues increase on the back of improved economic activity. The GOI’s 
deficit is projected to moderate to 5.9 percent of GDP. Fiscal pressures could strengthe n 
due to rising subsidy burden, hikes in policy rate increasing the cost of borrowing , and 
roll out of populist measures in a pre -election year.

India’s external debt is expected to remain stable.  
 
11. The current account deficit is projected at 1.8 percent of GDP for FY2023.  A 
slower than expected export growth due to the global slowdown and a higher import bill 
may put pressure on the current account deficit. Remittances may remain strong as a 
depreci ating rupee makes remittances more lucrative. Waning of global commodity price 
pressures and impetus to exports from some of the ongoing schemes would help current 
account deficit to moderate further."

1. India is making progress towards gender equality, but disparities still persist. In 
the fabric of the Indian Constitution, gender equality is deeply stitched, as captured in 
Article 14 that promotes equality, Article 15 that prohibits discrimination, and Article 39 
which emphasizes gender equality across poli tical, economic, and social realms.141 The 
Gender Development Index (GDI) has been steadily increasing in India from 0. 759 in 
2001  to 0.849 in 2021, but it remains still lower than the majority of the South Asian 
countries.142 The World Economic Forum's “ The Global Gender Gap Index 2022 ” ranks

fact that women in Indian cities rely on public transport more than men, these services 
are not customarily built considering their safety and specific travel needs.146 The 
prevalence of harassment in public transportation is also concerning, as in 2021, nearly 
56 percent of female passengers reported experiencing sexual harassment.147

B. GESI Practices in KMRL  
 
5. Women play a very relevant role at KMRL, and work within all its divisions. Even 
breaking stereotypes, they are outnumbering men in some traditionally considered 
male -oriented teams, such as operation and maintenance, facility management, and 
security.163  On average, nearly twice as many women as men are working at each 
station of Phase I,164 and some of them are mostly operated by women (e.g., the Muttom 
Station is entirely managed and run by female staff). KMRL has taken an unprecedented 
approach by employing 509 EWS women and 16 transgender people from the 
Kudumbashree Program165 (as of December 2023), mainly for housekeeping, security, 
and ticketing in the stations of Phase I. Women representation at corporate level is

management cadre, one of the three functional directors and two out of ten general 
managers/heads of departments are women. An internal committee at KMRL handles  
workplace sexual harassment complaints and often holds staff training on women's 
safety at the workplace.  
 
6. Several gender -responsive aspects are also visible in the design of the current 
trains and stations of Phase I. Dedicated seats are reserved for pregnant women and 
individuals with special needs.  Child feeding cubicles, diaper change pods, and sanitary

women about their rights and how to protect themselves from violence.  
 
C. GESI Strategy for Phase II

detailed climate risk assessment was conducted in the scope of 
the EDD R. As noted in the EDDR, the project location is highly 
exposed to recurring floods, and moderately exposed to 
increased precipitation, high temperature, increased wind 
speed, and water unavailability. The increased precipitation in 
the past few years, coup led with cyclonic storms, have led to 
recurrent floods in the project location. An increase has also 
been projected for mean annua l rainfall in both the near - and 
mid-term when compared to the historical period. The 
temperature projection indicates a potential increase of 1.3 -
1.8°C.169 The climate risk assessment also suggests that the 
project location is considered to have moderate exposure to 
increased wind, and it might face future water stress.

superior mechanical properties with potential to resist thermal 
stress; (ii) keeping sufficient open areas for unrestricted and 
cross air circulation to minimize the high tempe rature effect on 
passengers; (iii) constructing an elevated viaduct and stations, 
which will be less vulnerable to urban floodings; (iv) providing
